# Full Disclaimer

This project was written for my university final year project, way before I knew of good coding practices, proper unit testing, or a host of other things that in general would make a codebase not entirely terrible. The code written in this repo is saved here for historical reasons and absolutely does not reflect my capabilities as a software engineer in the present. Despite the awful code in this repo I'm still very proud of what I achieved for this project as the things I learned outside of the actual development of the project have laid the technical foundations to allow me to become a much more competant developer.

With that said, feel free to go and have a laugh at how atrocious some of it is.
